Our mission was to design and implement a fully autonomous AGV capable of following a navigation line, detecting block colours, collecting items from racks, and delivering them to the correct locations within the maze. The software architecture was structured to ensure reliability, modularity, and clear separation of sensor handling, actuation, navigation, and high-level control.


Mechanical design was also sustainable as we only used wood.
